# HeyGPT Voice Assistant
Voice based interface to ChatGPT

### Description
The project, built in node, aims to be a platform agnostic application to interact with ChatGPT using your voice, like a natural conversation.

The end goal is to provide an easy to install solution for a RaspberryPI based assistant.

This package aims to minimize its reliance on external packages as much as possible.

### Install
At this stage this project can only run on MacOS, more adapters will come soon.
The project requires node 18+

Create a `.env` file on the root of the project with the contents in .env.example

Then run `yarn install` and `yarn start` to launch.

More options can be found in `src/constants.js`
